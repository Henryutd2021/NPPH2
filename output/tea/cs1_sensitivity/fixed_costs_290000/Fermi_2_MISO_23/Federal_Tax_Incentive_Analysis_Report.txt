RECOMMENDATIONS
==================================================

1. The 48E Investment Tax Credit provides superior financial returns with an NPV
   improvement of $2,808,557,386 compared to the baseline scenario.

2. Both tax incentive scenarios improve project economics significantly:
   - 45Y PTC improves NPV by $1,548,604,995
   - 48E ITC improves NPV by $2,808,557,386

3. Consider the following factors when choosing between incentives:
   - PTC provides steady cash flows over 10 years
   - ITC provides immediate cash benefit but reduces depreciation
   - Risk tolerance and financing requirements
   - Regulatory and policy stability considerations
