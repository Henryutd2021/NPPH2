  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Different Lifecycle Key Differences Analysis and Conclusions:
    - Longer lifecycles generally improve NPV due to extended revenue generation and longer amortization of initial CAPEX.
    - LCOH and LCOE may decrease with longer amortization periods for fixed costs, though more replacement cycles are also incurred.
    - The relative benefit of tax incentives (PTC vs. ITC) may shift with different project lifetimes and cash flow profiles.
    - Decision-making should weigh improved long-term returns against potential increased risks and O&M over extended periods.


6. Lifecycle Cash Flow Analysis
--------------------------------
  Analysis of cash flow patterns across different project lifecycles,
  comparing existing plant retrofit scenarios with new construction projects.

  A. New Construction Lifecycle Comparison:

    IRR Improvement (80yr vs 60yr)      : N/A

  C. Existing Plant vs New Construction Comparison:
    Existing Plant Remaining Life: 13 years
    New Construction Options: 60 years (Case 4) or 80 years (Case 5)
    
    Key Insights:
    • Existing plants have limited remaining lifetime but lower initial investment
    • New construction requires higher CAPEX but offers full lifecycle benefits
    • 80-year lifecycle provides additional 20 years of revenue generation
    • Lifecycle extension significantly improves long-term financial metrics
