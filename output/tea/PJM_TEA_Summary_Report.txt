Key Insights:
  • The greenfield nuclear-hydrogen system shows negative NPV
  • IRR cannot be calculated (negative cash flows throughout project)
  • Payback period cannot be calculated (negative cash flows)

Accounting Method:
  • Independent accounting method used for LCOE/LCOH/LCOS calculations
  • LCOE: (nuclear costs + OPEX - turbine AS revenue) / total generation
  • LCOH: (H2 costs + OPEX + electricity at LCOE + HTE thermal - H2 AS revenue) / H2 production
  • LCOS: (battery costs + OPEX) / battery throughput
  • AS revenues calculated from real system deployment data, not estimates
  • HTE thermal energy opportunity cost included in LCOH calculation

Note: This greenfield analysis assumes building both nuclear plant and
hydrogen system from zero, with both systems designed for 60-year operation.
The analysis includes periodic replacement of H2 system components:
• Electrolyzers replaced every 20 years (2 replacements)
• H2 storage systems replaced every 30 years (1 replacement)
• Batteries replaced every 15 years (3 replacements)
• Enhanced maintenance costs (+20%) for extended lifecycle operation
This provides a comprehensive view of long-term integrated system economics.
