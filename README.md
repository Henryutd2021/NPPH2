# NPPH2: Optimizing Nuclear Plant Flexibility and Hydrogen Production for Grid Ancillary Services

## Overview

This project models and optimizes the economic operation of integrated nuclear power and hydrogen production systems. It employs a Pyomo-based optimization framework to maximize profits by optimizing the allocation of electricity between grid sales and hydrogen production, while considering ancillary services participation.

The primary focus is on enhancing nuclear power plant flexibility through the integration of electrolyzers and/or battery storage systems, enabling participation in grid ancillary services markets. The project performs detailed techno-economic feasibility analyses of these hybrid systems and explores how new technologies and strategic investments can increase nuclear power plant revenue streams.
