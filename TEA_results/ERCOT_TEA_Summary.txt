4. Incremental Financial Metrics (H2/Battery System Only)
------------------------------------------------------
These metrics represent the financial performance of the incremental
investment in H2/battery systems compared to the baseline nuclear plant.

Component Investment Breakdown:
  Electrolyzer CAPEX: $50,000,000.00 (74.6% of total)
  Battery CAPEX: $0.00 (0.0% of total)

Opportunity Cost Analysis:
  Annual Electricity Opportunity Cost: $30,118,511.06
  (This is the revenue foregone by using electricity for H2/battery instead of grid sales)

Incremental Analysis Approaches:
  1. Traditional Incremental: Compares total system to baseline nuclear operation
  2. Pure Incremental: Isolates H2/battery contribution with opportunity cost factored in

  The metrics below reflect the Pure Incremental approach, which provides a more
  accurate assessment of the H2/battery investment value by accounting for
  the opportunity cost of electricity that could have been sold to the grid.

Incremental Annual Electrolyzer MWh: $438,000.00
Incremental Avg Electricity Price: $68.76
Incremental IRR: N/A
Incremental LCOH: $154.773/kg
Incremental NPV: $-385,282,504.91
Incremental Payback Period: N/A
Incremental ROI: -100.00%

Note: Incremental metrics isolate the economic performance of the
H2/battery investment by comparing against baseline nuclear operation.
The analysis accounts for:
  - Additional capital costs for H2/battery equipment
  - Additional O&M costs for the H2/battery system
  - Revenue from hydrogen production
  - Opportunity costs from diverting electricity from grid sales to H2 production

A positive incremental NPV indicates that the H2/battery investment adds value
beyond what could be achieved by selling all electricity to the grid.

5. Component Costs (Base Year Estimates)

  H2_Storage_Year1: $5,000,000/kW (Year -2)
  H2_Storage_Year2: $5,000,000/kW (Year -1)
  NPP_Modifications: $2,000,000 (Year -2)

O&M Components (Base Annual):
  Fixed_OM: $1,000,000/year (Inflation: 2.0%/year)
  Variable_OM: (From Optimization) (Inflation: 2.0%/year)
  Water_Cost: (From Optimization) (Inflation: 3.0%/year)

6. Analysis Notes
----------------
- All financial metrics calculated using end-of-year cash flow convention.
- LCOH represents levelized cost over project lifetime including all capital and operating costs.
- NPV and IRR calculations account for the time value of money with the specified discount rate.
- Hydrogen subsidy effects are included according to provided parameters.
- No terminal/salvage value is assumed at the end of project lifetime.
- Incremental analysis compares the H2/battery system investment to baseline nuclear operation.
- ROI (Return on Investment) measures the profitability of the incremental investment.
- Opportunity costs of electricity (nuclear power that could have been sold to grid) are included.
- Both electrolyzer and battery investments are included in the incremental analysis.
